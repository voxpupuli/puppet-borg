#
# @param keep_yearly
#   For how many years should we keep our backups?
#
# @param keep_monthly
#   For how many months should we keep our backups?
#
# @param keep_weekly
#   For how many weeks should we keep our backups?
#
# @param keep_daily
#   For how many days should we keep our backups?
#
# @param keep_within
#   For how many days should we keep all backups we have?
#
# @param excludes
#   list of default mountpoints that should be excluded from backups. Every mountpoint needs to be explicitly excluded or included. See also the additional_excludes parameter.
#
# @param includes
#   list of default mountpoints that should be included from backups. Every mountpoint needs to be explicitly excluded or included. See also the additional_includes parameter.
#
# @param backupserver
#   FQDN for the remote server. Will be written into the local ssh client configuration file.
#
# @param install_restore_script
#   Install the restore helper via cpanm.
#
# @param restore_script_path
#   The path to the restore helper.
#
# @param backupdestdir
#   The path on the remote server where the backups should be written to.
#
# @param manage_repository
#   A Boolean that enables/disables repository management. Only true on Ubuntu 16.04 at the moment
#
# @param exclude_pattern
#   We currently support excludes/includes for mountpoints. borg supports also a list of shell glob/regex pattern to filter for files.
#
# @param additional_exclude_pattern
#   Another array of patterns to extend the modules built-in list (`exclude_pattern` parameter).
#
# @param restore_dependencies
#   A list of dependencies for the restore helper.
#
# @param package_ensure
#   Ensure state for the borg package.
#
# @param additional_excludes
#   Another array of mountpoints to extend the modules built-in list (`excludes` parameter).
#
# @param additional_includes
#   Another array of mountpoints to extend to modules built-in list (`includes` parameter).
#
# @param username
#   The ssh username to connect to the remote borg service.
#
# @param ssh_port
#   SSH port for the remote server (default: 22). Will be written into the local ssh client configuration file.
#
# @param borg_restore_version
#   Version for the perl script App::BorgRestore. change this version and the module will upgrade/downgrade it
#
# @param install_fatpacked_cpanm
#   cpanm is required on systems where we want to have App::BorgRestore. Legacy systems ship a too old cpanm version. For those operating systems we can install the upstream version.
#
# @param proxy_type
#   configue a network proxy *type* for the archive resources in this module. You also need to set `proxy_server` if you need a proxy.
#
# @param proxy_server
#   Configurea network proxy for the archive resources in this module. By default no proxy will be used
#
# @param manage_package
#   Enable/Disable management of the actual borg package. People on legacy OS or isolated environments can disable this and manage the binary in their profile.
#
# @param ssh_key_type
#   configure your most favourite ssh key type. This will be used to connect to the remote borg server.
